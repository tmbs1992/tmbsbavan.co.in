															<p>Despite all we do to make the platform secure, we advise some
															precautions while using our sites and apps:</p>

															<p>If a user appears to have entered false, incorrect information about 
															their education, profession, income, family etc., mark such profiles
															as ‘Report Abuse’ and refrain from contacting that user.
															If a user asks for personal favors like transportation of goods, 
															deposit of funds on their behalf, lend them some money etc., 
															immediately cease any communication with the user and do as advised above.
															Be cautious of fake or copy sites which may look similar but are
															 actually owned by people who may have malicious intent.
															 Many sites have a similar appearance as Tmbsbavan.co.in but
															 they are not in any way related or affiliated to Tmbsbavan.co.in. 
															 Please check the URL of the site <b>(it should be www.Tmbsbavan.co.in)</b> that you are visiting.
															Representatives from these fake sites may reach out to you to get 
															membership fee or for registering your profiles. Exercise caution
															 and alert our customer service if and when this happens.
															Beware of people who pretend to call from the Tmbsbavan team 
															asking for your user id’s and passwords to login to your account.
															 Please note that Tmbsbavan never asks you for user password 
															 information either on phone or in person.</p>
															<p>Never share your financial details like bank account number,
															 online banking credentials, credit card details etc. and be
															 wary of those who ask for money from you. Use sound judgement
															 and do not take any decision in a hurry.
															Meet with prospective partners you find on the platform in
															 a safe place and inform your family or friends of the meeting.
															Do a thorough background research about the person before
															 any commitments are made.</p>
															<p><b>Tmbsbavan.co.in</b> is merely a preliminary medium of contact 
															and exchange of information. Users are strongly advised to
															 conduct an independent check/due diligence prior to proceeding
															 with any decisions based on the content of the profile. 
															 The onus of verifying the authenticity of the information displayed on a profile lies on the user.</p>

															<p>In case you face any of the above stated situations or come
															 across a probable fake profile, immediately notify us on <b>tmbsbavan@gmail.com</b></p></p>

                            </div>
							<p style="text-align:justify"> Privacy and confidentiality features and tools at Tmbsbavan.co.in
														  At Tmbsbavan.co.in we believe that protecting the confidentiality
														  and privacy of our registered users is very important. 
														  For this reason , our basic features are designed to protect your
														  confidentialty. Further we have sophisticated tools that enable you
														  to set your privacy and confidentiality levels to those that you are comfortable with.</p>

														<p><b>A.</b> Universal Confidentiality features Profile design
														   Our profile format is designed so as to prevent people 
														   from identifying you unless you wish them to do so. Thus 
														   the information that is gathered is general in nature - age,
														   height, gender, caste, ethnicity, occupation, location, family 
														   profile, interests, desired partner profile etc. 
														   Typically information that will help generate interest among 
														   the right prospective life partners without individually identifying you.
														   Uploading photographs is optional.

														<p><b>B.</b> Protect your confidentiality At Tmbsbavan.co.in we understand that 
														   different people have different needs for privacy and confidentiality. 
														   Thus For this reason we empower our registrants with tools to customize
														   the privacy levels of their profile, photographs and contacts.</p>

														<b>Some of these settings are :
														For Profile</b>

														<p> Allow my detailed profile to be viewed by all visitors or
														Allow my detailed profile to be viewed only by registered users who pass my filters.
														Don't show my detailed profile or summary profile to any user, I will search and contact profiles.
														Profile visibility settings are available in the settings section which is accessible from the
														 header and footer on all pages after login. We recommend that you go in for the first privacy 
														 setting as that will get you the maximum response. Frequently our site is searched by casual 
														 browsers who are highly qualified, eligible people or friends and relatives of a prospective 
														 bride or groom and thus your profile is visible to this important group of visitors.
														 Of course if you wish to maintain a higher level of privacy and confidentiality then you can go 
														 in for the second option. And if you want the maximum level of privacy then you can select the third option.</p>

														<p> Please note that in the first two profile visibility options, your summary profile will be viewed by all visitors.
														 It will show your username, age, height, caste, occupation, city and date of updation.
														 Typically these are the details by which you cannot be identified. In the second case,
														 an unregistered user will be prompted to register and it will be checked if they pass 
														 your filters and only then would they be able to view your detailed profile. Whereas 
														 in the third case nobody will be able to view your summary or detailed profile. 
														 However, we would recommend you to go for the second option because the third option 
														 might minimize the number of responses your profile can get.</p>

														<b>For Photograph</b>
														In case you wish to upload your photograph(s) along with your profile then you have the following options :

														<p> I want my photos to be visible to all members.
														I want my photos to be visible only to members I contact and to members I accept.
														Thus you get to set that privacy level for your photograph which you feel most comfortable with.</p>

														<p> We would however recommend that you do upload your photographs and go in for the first privacy
														 setting option as that is likely to get you the maximum relevant response. The photograph privacy 
														 settings options are available in the 'My Photos' section of the 'My Profile' page. This page can
														 be accessed after you have registered your profile.</p>

														<b>For contacts</b>
														<p> When entering profile on Tmbsbavan.co.in you can specify criteria based on which people who
														 do not match your desired partner profile are unable to contact you. Thus you are not
														 bothered by people who you are clear you would not be interested in 
														 Filter setting are available once you have entered your desired partner profile.
														 So when you register with Tmbsbavan.co.in you register with the most confidential site. So register with confidence.</p> </p>
